Based on your answers, I would suggest considering an Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license such as the MIT License or the Apache License 2.0.

The Apache License is more verbose, but includes a patent clause for added protection.\n\nBoth of these licenses are permissive and do not come with many restrictions, allowing for the most flexibility in how others use and modify your code. They also both include disclaimers of warranty and liability, which can be helpful for avoiding legal issues down the line.\n\nDo you have any questions about these license options, or is there another license you've been considering?"}]}, "1684053426.210389": {"user": "U020682A8H5", "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the best way to state a license model in github?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Include the license file in the root directory of the repository."}]}}
